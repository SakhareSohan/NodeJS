The RIGHT JOIN keyword selects ALL records from the "right" table, and the matching records from the "left" table. The result is 0 records from the left side if there is no match.

Let's look at an example using our dummy testproducts table:

 testproduct_id |      product_name      | category_id
----------------+------------------------+-------------
              1 | Johns Fruit Cake       |           3
              2 | Marys Healthy Mix      |           9
              3 | Peters Scary Stuff     |          10
              4 | Jims Secret Recipe     |          11
              5 | Elisabeths Best Apples |          12
              6 | Janes Favorite Cheese  |           4
              7 | Billys Home Made Pizza |          13
              8 | Ellas Special Salmon   |           8
              9 | Roberts Rich Spaghetti |           5
             10 | Mias Popular Ice       |          14
(10 rows)
We will try to join the testproducts table with the categories table:

 category_id | category_name  |                       description
-------------+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------
           1 | Beverages      | Soft drinks, coffees, teas, beers, and ales
           2 | Condiments     | Sweet and savory sauces, relishes, spreads, and seasonings
           3 | Confections    | Desserts, candies, and sweet breads
           4 | Dairy Products | Cheeses
           5 | Grains/Cereals | Breads, crackers, pasta, and cereal
           6 | Meat/Poultry   | Prepared meats
           7 | Produce        | Dried fruit and bean curd
           8 | Seafood        | Seaweed and fish
(8 rows)

code syntax:
SELECT testproduct_id, product_name, category_name
FROM testproducts
RIGHT JOIN categories ON testproducts.category_id = categories.category_id;

Result
All records from categories, and only the matched records from testproducts:

 testproduct_id |      product_name      | category_name
----------------+------------------------+----------------
              1 | Johns Fruit Cake       | Confections
              6 | Janes Favorite Cheese  | Dairy Products
              8 | Ellas Special Salmon   | Seafood
              9 | Roberts Rich Spaghetti | Grains/Cereals
                |                        | Condiments
                |                        | Meat/Poultry
                |                        | Beverages
                |                        | Produce
