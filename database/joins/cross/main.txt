The CROSS JOIN keyword matches ALL records from the "left" table with EACH record from the "right" table.

That means that all records from the "right" table will be returned for each record in the "left" table.

This way of joining can potentially return very large table, and you should not use it if you do not have to.

Let's look at an example using our dummy testproducts table:

 testproduct_id |      product_name      | category_id
----------------+------------------------+-------------
              1 | Johns Fruit Cake       |           3
              2 | Marys Healthy Mix      |           9
              3 | Peters Scary Stuff     |          10
              4 | Jims Secret Recipe     |          11
              5 | Elisabeths Best Apples |          12
              6 | Janes Favorite Cheese  |           4
              7 | Billys Home Made Pizza |          13
              8 | Ellas Special Salmon   |           8
              9 | Roberts Rich Spaghetti |           5
             10 | Mias Popular Ice       |          14
(10 rows)
We will try to join the testproducts table with the categories table:

 category_id | category_name  |                       description
-------------+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------
           1 | Beverages      | Soft drinks, coffees, teas, beers, and ales
           2 | Condiments     | Sweet and savory sauces, relishes, spreads, and seasonings
           3 | Confections    | Desserts, candies, and sweet breads
           4 | Dairy Products | Cheeses
           5 | Grains/Cereals | Breads, crackers, pasta, and cereal
           6 | Meat/Poultry   | Prepared meats
           7 | Produce        | Dried fruit and bean curd
           8 | Seafood        | Seaweed and fish
(8 rows)

Note: The CROSS JOIN method will return ALL categories for EACH testproduct, meaning that it will return 80 rows (10 * 8).

Example
Join testproducts to categories using the CROSS JOIN keyword:
code syntax:
SELECT testproduct_id, product_name, category_name
FROM testproducts
CROSS JOIN categories;



Result
All categories for each testproduct will be returned:

 testproduct_id |      product_name      | category_name
