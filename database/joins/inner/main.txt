The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

Let's look at an example using our dummy testproducts table:

 testproduct_id |      product_name      | category_id
----------------+------------------------+-------------
              1 | Johns Fruit Cake       |           3
              2 | Marys Healthy Mix      |           9
              3 | Peters Scary Stuff     |          10
              4 | Jims Secret Recipe     |          11
              5 | Elisabeths Best Apples |          12
              6 | Janes Favorite Cheese  |           4
              7 | Billys Home Made Pizza |          13
              8 | Ellas Special Salmon   |           8
              9 | Roberts Rich Spaghetti |           5
            10 | Mias Popular Ice        |          14
(10 rows)

We will try to join the testproducts table with the categories table:

 category_id | category_name  |                       description
-------------+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------
           1 | Beverages      | Soft drinks, coffees, teas, beers, and ales
           2 | Condiments     | Sweet and savory sauces, relishes, spreads, and seasonings
           3 | Confections    | Desserts, candies, and sweet breads
           4 | Dairy Products | Cheeses
           5 | Grains/Cereals | Breads, crackers, pasta, and cereal
           6 | Meat/Poultry   | Prepared meats
           7 | Produce        | Dried fruit and bean curd
           8 | Seafood        | Seaweed and fish
(8 rows)

code syntax:
SELECT testproduct_id, product_name, category_name
FROM testproducts
INNER JOIN categories ON testproducts.category_id = categories.category_id;


Result
Only the records with a match in BOTH tables are returned:

 testproduct_id |      product_name      | category_name
----------------+------------------------+----------------
              1 | Johns Fruit Cake       | Confections
              6 | Janes Favorite Cheese  | Dairy Products
              8 | Ellas Special Salmon   | Seafood
              9 | Roberts Rich Spaghetti | Grains/Cereals
(4 rows)
