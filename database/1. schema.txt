> The end-users can use only those schemas that allow the separation of test tables and logic from production tables.
In the schema, we can efficiently achieve the data and can be applied to some of the following activities:
> We can quickly restore data, which is present in a distinct schema. Thus, the application-oriented schemas can be individually returned and backed up for recovery and time travel.
> When the application data is in a schema, we can manage the application changes. Therefore, a new version of the application can work on the table structure in a new schema, including a simple modification to the schema name.
> We can easily take the back-up of data present in a separate schema. And therefore, the unstable data can have several back-up plans from non-volatile data.

The Schema is a namespace which provides several objects such as
